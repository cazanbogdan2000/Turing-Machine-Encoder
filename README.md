# Turing-Machine-Encoder
    A python program that takes a state of a turing machine, and then will determine the
next state, based on some given rules. It has the option to verify if those rules lead
the machine to an end (that means the word is accepted), and also offers a k acceptance,
meaning that the machine will solve a given number of steps.
